Reinforced Concrete Continuous Beam Problems (CBPs) Benchmark Suite 
(c) Assoc.Prof.Dr.Hasan Tahsin ÖZTÜRK

NOTES:
The problem tools of the CBP benchmark suite are shared. You can use these tools with the COA or SOS algorithms proposed in the article. You can also use the problem tools for different algorithms.
Use the MAIN script to run the optimization and the DESIGN_VIEWER script to examine the design details.
